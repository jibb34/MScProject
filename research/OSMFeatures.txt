This is a list of useful OpenStreetMap features that can be gathered from nodes or ways pulled from the API

https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features

Categories with relevent features:

> Amenity (in general, every amenity that doesnt give a net + will give -)
   - cafe (+)
   - pub (+/-)
   - bicycle repair station (+)
   - fuel (+/-)
   - drinking water (++)
   - water point (++)
   - toilets (+)

> Barrier (generally considered negative, as it impedes movement, but could result in some positives (like no cars in section))
Any access control barrier that does not allow access should null any segment that potentially is generated through it.
   - kerb
   - cycle_barrier
   - debris

> Building (certain building types that attract cars will detract from safety score)

> Highway (bread and butter of road cycling, there are a lot of values we want to pay attention to)
   - Motorway (will null any segment)
   - trunk highway (Main A Roads) (also nulls segments)
   - primary Highway (Minor A Roads) (0)
   - Secondary Highway (B Roads) (+)
   - Tertiary Highway (small link roads) (+/- depending on road width)
   - unclassified highway (hardly used non-residential roads) (++)
   - link roads (all link roads that attach to any trunk or motorway are nulled) (0)
   - residential, service, and pedestrian roads given low score for training but high for safety
   - footpaths that are cycle-enabled (bicycle=yes)
   - cycleway (++++) always highly rated, unless other factors lower mark
   - cycleway lane, oneway:bicycle yes, share_busway, shared_lane cycleways have their own marking depending on the type
   - parking:<location>:orientation=<orientation> will determine the safety based on where the parking is in relation to bike path
  - Attributes useful for determining score: bicycle_road, embedded_rails, ford, incline, junction, lanes, lit, max_speed, motorroad, oneway:(bicycle), shoulder, smoothness, surface, tracktype, traffic_calming, bus stop, crossing, cyclist_waiting_aid, stop, traffic_signals. 

> Land Use (if a segment is created in this region it is automatically scored based on it)
   - commercial (-)
   - construction (--)
   - industrial (-)
   - residential (+)
   - farmland (+/-)
   - forest (+)
   - meadow (0)
   - vineyard (+)
   - landfill (--)

> Leisure (not too much here, but some entities can be considered a plus)
   - common (+)
   - park (+)
   - track (+)

> place:
  - places like city, borough, suburb, town, village, etc could be a good determiner of how busy the roads are likely to be

> public transport
   - areas with a lot of public transport stop_position, stop_area, etc will have lower suitability scores

> Railway
   - level_crossing

> route*
   - A route describes a collection of ways or nodes that are taken repeatedly by a particular entity (car bike, person, etc)
     this means that the entity named in the route is the primary method of travel for it.
   - bicycle (The biggest single + for this section)
   - bus (generally - since buses are scary)
   - road
     - interestingly, a useful feature is that a "road" relation will have local unique ref number, which is used to define a road purpose.
       this means that it is a natural separator for segments of our bike route.
   - detour

> properties** < secondary tags that can define additional information
   - bridge > could be used to define bridges as their own segments (generally are required for route mapping)
   - crossing > further refinement if a node is tagged with crossing (highway or railway)
   - ele > elevation value (VERY IMPORTANT) this may be useful if altitude is a consideration, as well as a fast grade calculation
   - width/est_width > describes the width of the road (wide roads more beneficial for cycling fast)
   - narrow > determines a temporary narrowing of a way (lots in a segment lowers its quality)
   - toilets > determines if there are usable toilets in area

> Restrictions
   - access > can be used to determine if access is granted for bikes (includes yes, permissive, designated)
   - bicycle > if = dismount or no, bikes are not allowed explicitly
   - if bicycle is granted (yes, permissive, designated), and the following are denied, increase the scores:
     > bus, foot, hgv, motorcar, motorcycle, taxi, vehicle
   - noexit: nulls any segments on the way that exists from an intersection
   - oneway: yes/no/-1
