+\section{Critical Reflection on Methodology}
+In developing this methodology, several compromises were made. Purely statistical methods risked over-segmenting minor elevation noise, while rigid thresholds missed the nuanced undulations riders perceive as rolling terrain. We therefore adopted a hybrid of central-difference slope and moving-average deviation metrics, then cross-validated our “expected” algorithmic labels against “observed” rider feedback on a set of test routes. Discrepancies—such as segments tagged as \emph{flat} that riders described as \emph{challenging}—fed back into an iterative calibration loop, ensuring our computational definitions stay grounded in real-world cycling experience rather than abstract mathematical constructs.

+\section{Comparison of Existing Tools}
+Before designing our bespoke segmentation engine, we evaluated three mainstream platforms:
+\begin{itemize}
+  \item \textbf{Strava:} Prioritises competitive segment times and social comparison. While post-ride analytics are rich, Strava offers no predictive insight into the physiological demands of a full route.
+  \item \textbf{Komoot:} Emphasises surface type and scenic value, presenting clear elevation profiles but not categorising terrain by training zone or variability essential for structured workouts.
+  \item \textbf{Google Maps:} Focuses on travel-time efficiency. Elevation data is coarse, and there is no framework for assessing cumulative training load or segment variability.
+\end{itemize}
+
+\section{Rejected Design Paths}
+During development we prototyped and then set aside several approaches:
+\begin{itemize}
+  \item \emph{Fourier-transform segmentation:} Offered frequency-domain insights but was overly sensitive to noise and computationally heavy.
+  \item \emph{Supervised ML on rider-labelled data:} Limited by lack of large, high-quality annotated datasets, which prevented robust model training.
+  \item \emph{OSM road-type heuristics:} Road classification (residential, trunk, cycleway) correlated poorly with actual terrain difficulty, since classification often reflects traffic rules rather than gradient patterns.
+\end{itemize}
+
+\section{Expanded LSEPI Analysis}
+We revisited the LSEPI (Legal, Social, Ethical, Political/Institutional) framework with new critical insights:
+
+\subsection{Legal}
+Use of OSM data mandates ODbL compliance. Any commercial deployment must ensure proper attribution and adhere to derivative work guidelines.
+
+\subsection{Social}
+Democratising structured training data empowers cyclists but risks over-reliance on algorithmic recommendations, potentially reducing individual exploration and experiential learning.
+
+\subsection{Ethical}
+Data sparsity in under-mapped or rural areas can bias suggestions, leading to unsafe or suboptimal routing for some users. Addressing this requires transparent communication of data confidence.
+
+\subsection{Political/Institutional}
+Incumbent platforms (e.g., Strava, Komoot) may resist integration of open-source analytics that threaten their proprietary models, posing barriers to adoption despite clear user benefits.
+
+\section{Expected vs Observed Outcomes}
+An essential part of our validation strategy compared algorithmic predictions with rider reports. For example, when the engine classified a section as \emph{rolling} but multiple riders described it as a sustained climb, we reviewed and adjusted the amplitude and prominence thresholds. This feedback loop ensured our segmentation remained meaningful to cyclists and not just mathematically consistent.
