For transition:

we need to iterate through our locations, L, and observe L+1
for each candidate r in L:
  calc the distance between L and every r in L+1 using route planner
  compare route distance to haversine distance of L and L+1
  correct matches will be roughly the same, so probability would become:

p = 1/beta * e ^ ()-(diff in haversine and route distance)/beta)
