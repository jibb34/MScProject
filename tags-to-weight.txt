barrier: access control barriers are a merge cost of 1 (guaranteed separation), linear barriers are mostly 0 cost

Highway: change of highway type is a default merge cost of 0.5 
Ranked from lowest to highest car popularity, the difference in the individual weighting of 2 segments is multiplied with the default merge cost, giving a maximum of 1
  > motorway -> motorway should never be hit since weighting is 0, but will always return a result of 1 since motorway is bad to go on
  > trunk 1.9
  > primary 1.8
  > secondary 1.5
  > tertiary 1.0
  > unclassified 1.0
  > road 1.0
  > residential 0.5
  > living street 0
the following highway types always incur a cost of 1 since link roads almost always mean changing roads
  > motorway_link
  > trunk_link
  > primary_link 
  > secondary link
  > tertiary link
  > any misc road type: {bridleway, footway,service,track,path. etc}

cycleway: changing cycleway type has a merge cost of .2. Changing onto a cycleway (none to some, some to none) has a merge cost of 1

if highway has attribute junction, it has merge cost of 1

maxspeed: merge cost is the difference between 2 section's values * 0.02

mountain_pass = yes means merge cost of 1 (top of mountain)

smoothness: ranking from smoothest to least smooth. Difference * 0.05 for weighting
  > excellent = 1
  > good = .9
  > intermediate = 0.7
  > bad = 0.5
  > horrible = 0.4
  > very horrible = 0.2
  > impassable -> automatic 1 merge cost

surface: going from paved-unpaved gives a merge score of .6, anything else gives score of .1
