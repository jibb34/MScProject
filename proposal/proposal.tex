    \section{Overview}
    This project proposes the development of a web application that generates and analyzes bike ride routes, providing feedback on training suitability based on metrics such as power, cadence, heart rate, and other relevant data. The application will offer functionality similar to MapMyRide or Strava, allowing users to plot bike routes, visualize them on a map, and save them as .gpx files. Additionally, it will apply an algorithm to assess the training suitability of routes based on user-specified training goals.

    The project will be developed using React for the frontend, Go for the backend, and SQLite for data storage. The algorithm will analyze segments of routes to score them for specific training purposes such as endurance, interval training, or strength training.

    \section{Objectives}
